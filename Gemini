Step 1: Analyze the Geometry at Impending Slip
At θ = 90°, the rods form a right-angled triangle PRQ at vertex R.
Using the Pythagorean theorem, the distance PQ on the ground is:
PQ = sqrt(5^2 + 12^2) = sqrt(25 + 144) = 13 m

Step 2: Resolve Forces at Pin-Joint R
The vertical force F is applied at R. This force is distributed as 
compressive axial forces in rods PR (F_PR) and RQ (F_RQ).
Since it is a right angle at R:
F_PR = F * cos(angle at P) = F * (5/13)
F_RQ = F * cos(angle at Q) = F * (12/13)
Wait, a simpler way is using the angles: 
sin(P) = 12/13, cos(P) = 5/13
sin(Q) = 5/13, cos(Q) = 12/13

Step 3: Calculate Normal Reactions (N) and Horizontal Forces (H)
For Rod PR at point P:
N_P = F_PR * sin(P) = (F * 5/13) * (12/13)  -- Vertically transmitted part
H_P = F_PR * cos(P) = (F * 5/13) * (5/13)   -- Horizontally transmitted part

For Rod RQ at point Q:
N_Q = F_RQ * sin(Q) = (F * 12/13) * (5/13)
H_Q = F_RQ * cos(Q) = (F * 12/13) * (12/13)

Alternatively, by taking moments about Q and P for the whole system:
N_P * 13 = F * 12  => N_P = (12/13)F
N_Q * 13 = F * 5   => N_Q = (5/13)F

Step 4: Equilibrium of Horizontal Forces
The horizontal thrust (T) pushing outwards at P and Q must be equal:
T = N_P * tan(90-P) = N_P * (5/12) = (12/13)F * (5/12) = (5/13)F
Check at Q: T = N_Q * tan(90-Q) = N_Q * (12/5) = (5/13)F * (12/5) = (12/13)F
Correction: The horizontal force at each point is H = F * (sinα cosα) 
where α is the angle with the vertical.
H = F * ( (5/13) * (12/13) ) = (60/169)F (This is same for both P and Q)

Step 5: Apply Friction Law (f = μN) at Impending Slip
At P: μ_P * N_P = H  => μ_P * (12/13)F = (60/169)F
μ_P = (60/169) * (13/12) = 5/13

At Q: μ_Q * N_Q = H  => μ_Q * (5/13)F = (60/169)F
μ_Q = (60/169) * (13/5) = 12/13

Step 6: Calculate the Ratio
Ratio = μ_Q / μ_P
Ratio = (12/13) / (5/13)
Ratio = 12 / 5
Ratio = 2.40
