Given:
Two rigid massless rods PR and RQ
Length PR = 5 m
Length RQ = 12 m
R is a frictionless pin joint
P and Q are on rough horizontal ground
A vertical force F acts downward at R
At θ = 90°, impending slip occurs simultaneously at P and Q

Let:
Coefficient of friction at P = μ_P
Coefficient of friction at Q = μ_Q

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: Geometry at θ = 90°

At θ = 90°, the two rods PR and RQ are perpendicular at R.

Rod PR is inclined leftwards and touches ground at P  
Rod RQ is inclined rightwards and touches ground at Q

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: Nature of forces at P and Q

At impending slip:
Friction force = limiting friction

At P:
F_P = μ_P × N_P

At Q:
F_Q = μ_Q × N_Q

Normal reactions at P and Q are vertical.
Friction forces act horizontally (opposing motion).

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 3: Consider equilibrium of joint R

Since rods are massless and R is a pin joint,
forces in rods PR and RQ act along their lengths.

Let:
Force in rod PR = T₁
Force in rod RQ = T₂

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 4: Resolve forces at joint R

At R:
Vertical equilibrium:
T₁ sin(θ₁) + T₂ sin(θ₂) = F

Horizontal equilibrium:
T₁ cos(θ₁) = T₂ cos(θ₂)

At θ = 90° between rods:
Angle rod PR makes with horizontal:
tan θ₁ = (12 / 5)
⇒ sin θ₁ = 12 / 13
⇒ cos θ₁ = 5 / 13

Angle rod RQ makes with horizontal:
tan θ₂ = (5 / 12)
⇒ sin θ₂ = 5 / 13
⇒ cos θ₂ = 12 / 13

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 5: Horizontal equilibrium at R

T₁ cos θ₁ = T₂ cos θ₂

T₁ (5/13) = T₂ (12/13)
⇒ T₁ / T₂ = 12 / 5

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 6: Forces transmitted to ground

At P:
Horizontal force = T₁ cos θ₁ = T₁ (5/13)
Normal reaction N_P = T₁ sin θ₁ = T₁ (12/13)

At Q:
Horizontal force = T₂ cos θ₂ = T₂ (12/13)
Normal reaction N_Q = T₂ sin θ₂ = T₂ (5/13)

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 7: Apply limiting friction condition

At P:
μ_P = (Horizontal force) / (Normal force)
μ_P = [T₁ (5/13)] / [T₁ (12/13)]
μ_P = 5 / 12

At Q:
μ_Q = [T₂ (12/13)] / [T₂ (5/13)]
μ_Q = 12 / 5

--------------------------------------------------
STEP 8: Required ratio

μ_Q / μ_P = (12/5) / (5/12)
μ_Q / μ_P = (12 × 12) / (5 × 5)
μ_Q / μ_P = 144 / 25
μ_Q / μ_P = 5.76

--------------------------------------------------
FINAL ANSWER:

μ_Q / μ_P = 5.76
