Problem 3.16: Two rigid massless rods PR and RQ are joined at R with a pin-joint.
P and Q are resting on ground at P and Q respectively.
A vertical force F acts on pin R as shown.

Given:
- PR = 5 m
- RQ = 12 m
- At θ = 90°, impending slip occurs simultaneously at points P and Q
- When 0 < θ < 90°, the rods remain in static equilibrium due to Coulomb friction

Find: The ratio (μQ/μP) rounded to two decimal places

Step 1: Analyze the geometry at θ = 90°
When θ = 90°, the configuration forms a right angle at R.
Let's denote:
- Angle at P = α
- Angle at Q = β
- At θ = 90°: α + β = 90°

From geometry:
tan α = RQ/PR = 12/5
tan β = PR/RQ = 5/12

Step 2: Set up equilibrium conditions
For impending slip at both P and Q simultaneously:
- Friction at P: fP = μP × NP (maximum friction)
- Friction at Q: fQ = μQ × NQ (maximum friction)

Step 3: Apply force equilibrium at point R
Vertical equilibrium: NP sin α + NQ sin β = F
Horizontal equilibrium: NP cos α = NQ cos β

From horizontal equilibrium:
NP/NQ = cos β/cos α

Step 4: Apply moment equilibrium about point P
Taking moments about P (counterclockwise positive):
F × (PR cos α) = NQ × (PR sin α + RQ sin β) + fQ × RQ cos β

Step 5: Apply moment equilibrium about point Q
Taking moments about Q (counterclockwise positive):
F × (RQ cos β) = NP × (PR sin α + RQ sin β) + fP × PR cos α

Step 6: Use the impending slip condition
At impending slip:
fP = μP × NP
fQ = μQ × NQ

From the geometry and equilibrium conditions:
μP × PR cos α = μQ × RQ cos β

Therefore:
μQ/μP = (PR cos α)/(RQ cos β)

Step 7: Calculate the trigonometric values
For the triangle with sides PR = 5, RQ = 12:
Hypotenuse PQ = √(5² + 12²) = √(25 + 144) = √169 = 13 m

cos α = PR/PQ = 5/13
cos β = RQ/PQ = 12/13

Step 8: Calculate the ratio
μQ/μP = (PR × cos α)/(RQ × cos β)
μQ/μP = (5 × 5/13)/(12 × 12/13)
μQ/μP = (25/13)/(144/13)
μQ/μP = 25/144
μQ/μP = 0.17361...

Rounding to two decimal places:
μQ/μP = 0.17

Final Answer: The ratio (μQ/μP) = 0.17
